    "### 🚀 Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **🧠 Dual-Agent Architecture**: Job Matching & Bias Classification agents\n",
    "- **🔄 LangGraph Workflow**: State management with re-evaluation loops\n",
    "- **⚡ Rate Limiting**: Smart API throttling and retry mechanisms  \n",
    "- **📊 Batch Processing**: Efficient CSV processing with progress tracking\n",
    "- **🛡️ Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception management and logging\n",
    "- **📈 Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and resource tracking\n",
    "- **💾 Results Export**: Multiple output formats (JSON, CSV, reports)\n",

I've worked at two startups where I built scalable data pipelines and deployed ML models to production. I'm particularly passionate about building systems that can handle large-scale data processing.\n",

    "    Interviewer: That's great! Can you walk me through a challenging project you've worked on recently?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Candidate: Certainly! At my last company, we needed to process real-time user behavior data to power our recommendation engine. The challenge was handling 10M+ events per day while maintaining low latency. I designed and implemented a streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka and Python microservices. The system reduced recommendation latency from 500ms to under 100ms and improved user engagement by 15%.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Interviewer: Impressive! How did you handle the scalability aspects?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Candidate: I used a combination of horizontal scaling with Kubernetes and optimized data structures. I also implemented caching strategies using Redis and used async programming in Python to handle concurrent requests efficiently. We also set up comprehensive monitoring to catch performance issues early.\n",

    "    Interviewer: What interests you about this machine learning engineer position?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Candidate: I'm excited about the opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI applications. Your company's focus on responsible AI development really resonates with me. I'd love to contribute to building systems that are not only performant but also fair and transparent. I'm particularly interested in your work on bias detection in ML models.\n",

    "\n",
    "John: I've been working with Python for about 5 years now, primarily using Django for web development. At TechCorp, I led the migration of our monolithic application to a microservices architecture using Django REST framework. This involved breaking down the application into smaller, manageable services and implementing proper API design patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interviewer: How do you approach mentoring junior developers?\n",
    "\n",
    "John: I believe in hands-on mentoring. At TechCorp, I worked with 3 junior developers, conducting regular code reviews and pair programming sessions. I always try to explain the 'why' behind design decisions, not just the 'how'. I also encourage them to take ownership of smaller features while providing guidance and support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interviewer: Can you describe a challenging technical problem you solved?\n",
    "\n",
    "John: One significant challenge was optimizing our database queries. We had performance issues with complex joins that were causing 5-second load times. I analyzed the query patterns, implemented database indexing strategies, and introduced caching layers. This reduced response times from 5 seconds to under 500ms, which was a 90% improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interviewer: How do you stay updated with new technologies?\n",
    "\n",
    "John: I regularly read tech blogs, contribute to open-source projects, and attend local meetups. I also experiment with new technologies in side projects before considering them for production use.\n",
